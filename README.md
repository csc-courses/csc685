### Introduction to Quantum Cryptography

This will be a [Monday-only workshop](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/csc595.231/) on the wonderful new world of Quantum Cryptography. 

Cryptography is mainly about keeping and sending secrets. Beginning in the 1970's, cryptographic techniques were created to migrate into the cyber-realm those human ceremonies that demand trust or confidentiality . For instance, the signing of a document, or the arrival at an agreement, retaining all the necessary complexities of face to face negotiation. This change of focus could be milestoned by the [New Directions](https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf) paper of Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.

A substantial challenge to the field of cryptography is the quickly advancing technology of quantum computing. With quantum computing, scientists and technologist harness the weird physics of the quantum world to go beyond the current capabilities of classical computers. These machine pose theoretical challenges to the theories that support cryptography, and also enable devastating attacks against our current crypto-capabilities.

This course will introduce you to quantum computing, with only a requirement of probability and linear algebra, or the interest to learn basic probability and linear algebra, to go over the classical curriculum of information theory and cryptography, as it pertains to the course; and to introduce the quantum world of cryptography. You will perform experiments on quantum computers. 

The 221 edition of the course is found under the edition-221 folder.
