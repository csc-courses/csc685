    "A quantum state is described by a vector that describes how the state will act when measured. It is not an indication of a state, but of the possibly outcomes of a measurement, and the probability of each outcome. Once a measure has been made and an outcome achieved, the state becomes classical. Then the distinction between a state and a measurement outcome is superfluous &mdash; any future measurement will confirm with certainty the known state of the system.\n",
