    "### H: The Hadamard Gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computation in the model we are considering, is the construction of quantum circuits out of quantum gates. The inputs and output to the gates a quantum bits, called qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to be familiar with classical bits and digital logic gates. Those gates implement the logical functions of and, or and not. These are the operations in a boolean algebra where the numbers are True and False, and the operations are and, or a not. All classical computers are built from those basic gates combined over a billion times in billions of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computation takes this as a model idea, but uses quantum bits, or qubits, and quantum gates, that are created by developing a Hamiltonian (not the Broadway Play) around the qubit letting it evolve by Schödinger's equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first gate we shall learn is the H gate, short for Hadamard Gate, named after Jaques Hadamard (1865&ndash;1963) a French mathematcian that briefly taught at Columbia University in New York City. \n",
    "\n",
    "Th gate takes one qubit input and gives a one qubit output that is a superposition of two states &mdash; it is both true and false at the same time. It is a good starting point for thinking about and understanding the quantum phenomenon of superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, a bit is either 0 or 1. What explains quantum behavior best is that a vector of possibilities can be established, and unless measured, the quantum bit can evolve simultaneously along each possibility, and the outcomes of the computation are not only values, but probabilities of obtaining those values, when the qubit is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement will provide information to a world that can only understand classical information, and hence once measured, and the qubit decides in retrospect which quantum superposed path to reveal to the world, all other pathes become an historical untruth. There is no way of knowing anything about those other paths. The veil between the quantum world and the classical world is a Rule of Nature, and we cannot break from this rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the state of a qubit is a vector in a complex space of dimension two. One dimension is called $|0\\rangle$, and the other $|1\\rangle$. The Bloch Sphere depicts one as up and the other down, and when realized as, say the spin on an electron (a Fermion), one is \"up\" and the other \"down\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the suggestion that up and down are not orthgonal (at right angles), but opposite, up and down are, as vectors in the complex vector space of dimention two, $\\cal{C}^2$, orthogonal. So the plus state, given by the Hadamard gate acting on a $|0\\rangle$, gives the minus state when acting on a $|1\\rangle$.\n"
