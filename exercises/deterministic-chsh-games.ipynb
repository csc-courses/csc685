    "##  Deterministic CHSH-Like Games\n",

    "_course: quantum cryptography for beginners\n",
    "<br>date: 3 november 2022\n",
    "<br>author: burton rosenberg_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHSH-Like games are a framework in which Alice and Bob provide inputs $a$ and $b$ to jointly compute a function $f(a,b)$ which is to match a function $g(x,y)$. The match is tested by a random choice of inputs $x$ and $y$, and Alice is given $x$ and Bob is given $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note we call $x$ and $y$ the outcome of a fair coin toss, tossed fairly according to the protocol, by Aice and Bob, respectively. We call $a$ and $b$ the play of Alice and Bob, respectively, and often frame it as a choice of Red or Green, to help avoid confusion with the coin toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "We model Alice and Bob with standard models of computation. To make the model precise, there is a third player, Eve,that communicates with Alice and Bob and concludes whether they have won or lost on this round of play. The model will be Turing Machines augmented with various tapes to provide private random bits, a common random bit string, and augmented with a communication chanel used for communication between Alice and Eve, and between Bob and Eve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The space-like seperation between Alice and Bob means they cannot communicate. That is, a photon sent by Alice to Bob at the start of the game will not arrive before the game round has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional assumption is Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of qubits, with Alice capable of measuring her qubit of the pair as she wishes, and Bob likewise capable of measuring his qubit of the pair as he wishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup was created to show the violation of the Bell Inequality, which would disqualify the Hidden Variable Theory for quantum mechanics, proposed by Einstein in order to avoid _Spukhafte Fernwirkung_, spookey action at a distance. The experiment is named after John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt, and was proposed in 1969.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The game\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob each have a machine with a button that when pushed flips a fair coin. The box has two lights on top, one red and one green, the Alice and Bob will light to signal their decision based on the coin flip. They also half each one half of an EPR pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assure Alice and Bob do not communicate after the coin flips, the Alice and Bob and their boxes will be placed light years apart, and their buttons will be pushed simultaneously by using a laser signal sent from Eve situated at the midpoint between Alice and Bob. \n",
    "\n",
    "The light colors and coin flips are sent back to Eve by a laser signal for Eve's determination of the game outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On receiving Alice and Bob coin flips and play, Eve scores this way,\n",
    "\n",

    "Hence Alice and Bob both have a strategies $\\cal{A}(a,h), \\cal{B}(b,h) \\in\\{\\,\\!\\mbox{R, G}\\}$\n",
    "with $a,b\\in_R \\{\\,0,1\\,\\}$, two unbaised independently drawn random variables, and $h$ some common strategy data.\n",

    "\n",
    "If Alice and Bob are given different and independent $\\omega$ this is the private coin model. If they are given the same $\\omega$ that is the public (or common) coin model. The public randomness can be implemented by firing a stream of photons from the location where the start beam originates. The bits will arrive delayed, but at the same time, and the stream can be started hours before, so that there is a stream of random bits arriving during the time window that the algorithm must run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized is strictly more powerful than deterministic, because the algorithm could ignore $\\omega$. And public is more powerful that private, because Alice and Bob collude.\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of the game, the ultimate outcome is not affected by randomness. The win probablity is an average over the random coins, and so at least one particular random coin outcome will be at least as good as the average. Fixing that outcome will de-randomize the algorithm with win probability at least as high as any randomized algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomness can, however, shape the outcome. And it appears (unproven) that some shapes require the full power of a shared random coin.\n"

    "### The Play Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The deterministic play strategies are called pure. Four deterministic play stragegies are possible which give the optimal result of a 3/4 probability of winning. Each achieves the 3/4 probability by winning on 3 coin outcomes and losing on the fourth. Each loses are a different one of the four outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ The simplest stratgey is Alice and Bob agree on a color and always play that color. This loses only on Head-Head. A lose on only the outcome Tails-Tails is acheived by Alice and Bob both reporting their own coin result, using opposing conventions to map Heads-Tails to Red-Green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed strategies use a coin flip to blend optimal strategies. Blending two stratigies will give an optimal stratgey that achives a win always on two coin outcomes, and probability 1/2 wins of the other two coin outcomes. There is no coin outcome with zero probability of winning. The number 1/2 is the coin bias, and I have chosen a fair coin just for the simplicity of exposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the blend can be achived by only one player having to mix strategies, the randomness can be private to the one player that is mixing their strategy. There are four cases where this occurs. However, if both players must mix strategies, and it must be done in a coordinated fashion, a public random coin is required. There are two cases where this occurs.\n",
