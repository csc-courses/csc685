    "The CHSH game has a strategy that uses an entangled pair of qubits to win a game of chance with great probability than can be achieved with any non-quantum strategy. The essence of the game is two plays flip coins and then post an outcome, we will call it red or green, that is scored according to the coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the players could communicate after the coin flips, their winnings would be perfect. But they cannot. Neither knows the others coin flips, hence must play the odds as best as they can. Essentially the players must predict when the coin flips were heads-heads. They can only win at this game one out of four trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if each player has one qubit of an entangled pair of qubits, they can make a measurement on their quibit that depends on the coin flip. The entanglement will correlate the measures so that the players can signal when they have tossed a heads, allowing for a coordinated action in the case of heads-heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment is named after John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt, and was proposed in 1969. It was based on trying to prove Bell's Inequality, which gave a framework to test certain hidden-variable theories. "

    "Following the tradition in describing cryptographic protocols, our two players are Alice and Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob each have a machine with a button that when pushed flips a fair coin. The box has two lights on top, one red and one green, the Alice and Bob will light to signal their decision based on the coin flip. They also half each one half of an EPR pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assure Alice and Bob do not communicate after the coin flips, the Alice and Bob and their boxes will be placed light years apart, and their buttons will be pushed simultaneously by using a laser signal sent from a midpoint location between Alice and Bob. The light colors and a message about the coin flips will be sent back to the umpire at the source location of the laser, to determine if the game has been won or list.\n",

    "Alice and Bob can trade-off certainty in all cases for some winning in all cases by having Alice always play green and Bob play green on tails, but on heads play green with probability $p$ and red with probability $1-p$. Working through the math, this still gives 3/4 for all $p$. With $p=0$ we have the null strategy, and with $p=1$ we have another deterministic strategy, this one with tails-heads always losing and the other three cases always winning.\n",

    "However, if Alice and Bob can communicate, they can simply reveal their coins and will all the time. The CHSH game is constructed to make classical communication between Alice and Bob impossible, but uses an entangled qubit pair to create a channel of correlation between Alice and Bob. \n"
