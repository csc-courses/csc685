    "A quantum state is described by a vector that describes how the state will act when measured. It is not an indication of a state, but of the possibly outcomes of a measurement, and the probability of each outcome. Once a measure has been made and an outcome achieved, the state becomes classical. Then the distinction between a state and a measurement outcome is superfluous &mdash; any future measurement will confirm with certainty the known state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of a quantum system consisting of a single qubit is the probabilty of one of two outcomes, and the collapse of the state to the classical state associated with that outcome. The qubit is a unit vector in  $\\mathbb{C}^2$ modulo a global phase, as this is provides a general framework to support the registration of this measurement regime.\n",

    "- It is a unit vector because the probability of the outcomes sum to 1;\n",
    "- modulo a global phase, as the global phase does not affect a complex numbers's length;\n",
