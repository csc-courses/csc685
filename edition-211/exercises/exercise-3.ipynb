    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we look at the quantum one time pad. There is an exploration of what does the result of a probabilistic algorithm mean, including the complexity class RP. The class RP touches a bit on the difference between information and knowlege. While our previous adversaries were judged on how often they were correct, even if that correctness were accident, the complexity class RP introduces a deliberateness in the algorithm's reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that two classical bits can be used to disguise entirely a quantum bit from an eavesdropper. If the communicating parties, Alice and Bob, agree in a pair of classical random bits, or a stream of $2n$ such bits when sending $n$ qubits, then they can send qubits on a public channel with perfect secrecy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This extends the classical result of Shannon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we get our imports and IBM account loaded, plus def some helpful procedures. We will continue after this following code block.\n"

    "\n",
    "Our measurements have been in the _computational basis_, also called the $Z$ basis. This means that if the qubit is $|0\\rangle$ then the measurement result is 0, and if the qubit is $|1\\rangle$ then the measurement result is 1. Very convenient, thanks mostly to the notation. However, if the qubit is in any other state, the measurement is probabilistic, and it adjusts the qubit to agree with how the measurement turned out. \n",
    "\n",
    "A $|+\\rangle$ state qubit half the time measures  $|0\\rangle$ and is then in the state $|0\\rangle$ and the other half the time measures  $|1\\rangle$ and is then in the state $|1\\rangle$.\n",

    "It is possible to measure the qubit in the $X$ basis. This basis is aligns a 0 outcome along the state $|+\\rangle$. It is important to note that the 1 outcome will them be the state orthogonal to this, and be $|-\\rangle$. This was also true in the  $Z$ basis. The states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ are orthogonal, so once we are setup to measure $|0\\rangle$ as 0 with certainty, then we would measure $|1\\rangle$ as 1 with certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure on the $X$ basis, do a transformation before the measurement to bring the desired measurement basis to the computational basis. This transformation is $H$. \n",

    "### Exercise A\n",

    "$$\n",
    "This is a random function driven by the random choice $b\\in\\{\\,0,1\\,\\}$. We will assume that both outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Alice does not encrypt, so the qubit on the channel is the qubit generated, $\\tilde{q} = G(b)$. Eve's first algorithm $E_0$ is to measure $\\tilde{q}$ in the computational basis and then outputs a bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your exercise is to consider how $E_0$ arrives at its output to maximize the probability it guesses correctly, and to give that probability. The probability the algorithm is correct is,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Pr\\,\\{ E_0(G(b))==b \\,\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the probability is over the choice of $b$ and any random choices $E_0$ might take.\n",

    "### Exercise C\n",
    "\n",
    "An RP type algorithm. Write a third algorithm $E_{RP}$ gives an output of the _RP_ kind. An RP algorithm is an inherently probabilistic algorihthm that gives an error-free decision for one side of the question. It is, however only one side, in that the other possible answer is that the algorithm does not know. The opposite of Yes is not No, for these algorithms. The opposite of Yes is it might be, or it might not be. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilistic constrant for an _RP_ algorithm is that is has a maximum probability of claiming ignorance of something less than 1, and it will never answer falsely the opposite side of the question.\n",

    "for some $d<1$, where the probability is taken over the probability of this input, the classical probability in the algorithm, and the quantum probability in the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first probability equation states that if the alogrithm outputs a 1, then the input is surely a $|+\\rangle$, since it is probability zero that it is a $|0\\rangle$. The second probability equation forbids that the algorithm achieve correctness by simply never outputting a 1. With probabiliy $1-d$ it will identify the input correctly and say so. This requires that a $|+\\rangle$ is presented sufficiently often. Our assumption is we expect half of the inputs to be $|+\\rangle$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have shown that two classical secret bits are sufficient to hide from Eve whether a $|0\\rangle$ or $|+\\rangle$ qubit is being sent over a public channel. However, the method that encrypts with $Z^s X^r$ in fact hides an arbitrary state from Eve. We explore this with a new state: $|\\ominus_L\\rangle$, and it's opposite $|\\ominus_R\\rangle$.\n",

    "to measure in the _circular basis_, use the inverse of this transformation and then measure in the compuational basis. This will bring the proper state to measure a certain 0 and its opposite a certain 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "The fact is that the two bits make a one time pad that transmits and arbitrary state from Alice to Bob without Eve learning anything. While the other exercises just did the 0 and plus basis, this introduces a new basis, but what you want to get the idea of is that any basis is secure. There are an infinity of basis so we would actually need a proof, but for now we just want to experiement with actual examples.\n",
