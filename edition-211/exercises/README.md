#### Notes on the exercises.


_9 sept 2020_

On exercise 2, for the 5 qubit adder. A nice additional exercise is to send the superposition of all states on the first 3 qubits only, and see that one can read off the function on the 8 possible (of 16) outputs.

- Exercise 1: Quantum Circuits, Quantum Gates. H and X gates.
- Exercise 2: Reversiblity, Toffoli Gate. Classic circuits. Adversarial guessing games.
- Exercise 3: Quantum One time Pad.
- Exercise 4: Measurements and Observables.
- Exercise 5: Kronecker Product. Bernstein-Vazirani.
- Exercise 6: Simon's Algorithm.
- Exercise 7: CHSH game.
